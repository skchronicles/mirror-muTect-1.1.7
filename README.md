# MuTect 1.1.7 JAR

This GitHub repository contains a pre-compiled JAR for `Mutect/1.1.7`. It functionality act as a release mirror for [MuTect](https://github.com/broadinstitute/mutect). I am not a maintainer or author of the tool. 

### _*Why?*_  
The original developers of MuTect no longer supported it as a stand-alone application.  Version 1.1.7 was the last available version. MuTect's functionality has been merged with GATK since 2015 and has been succeeded by Mutect2. With that being said, the Broad did not create a 1.1.7 release containing a pre-compiled mutect 1.1.7 jar file. Please see this [thread](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061643992-jar-for-mutect-1-1-7) for more information.

> _*Please Note:*_ This JAR file was compiled with `java/1.7.0_80`, and testing has shown it will only work with `java/1.7`.
